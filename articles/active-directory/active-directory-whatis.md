# What is Azure Active Directory?





Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service. It is the service you use every day to login to Office365, Azure.com and many other cloud services for business from Microsoft. If you use any of these services today, you already have the free version of Azure Active Directory!

Azure AD provides an affordable, easy to use solution to give employees and business partners single sign-on (SSO) access to [thousands of cloud SaaS Applications](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2014/09/03/50-saas-apps-now-support-federation-with-azure-ad.aspx) like Office365, Salesforce.com, DropBox, and Concur.

And if you area developer, it's easy to integrate your application with Azure AD giving you an easy way to make your application enterprise ready without having to build complicated identity management systems.

The Premium version of Azure AD includes a full suite of identity management capabilities including multi-factor authentication, self-service password management, self-service group management, privileged account management, role based access control, application usage monitoring, rich auditing and security monitoring and alerting. These capabilities can help secure cloud based applications, streamline IT processes, cut costs and help assure corporate compliance goals are met.

Getting Azure AD work is super easy. It's cloud based solution that you can start using immediately. And if you already have a Window Server Active Directory, With only [four clicks](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2014/08/04/connecting-ad-and-azure-ad-only-4-clicks-with-azure-ad-connect.aspx), Azure AD can be integrated with your existing Windows Server Active Directory, which lets you use the same user identities and groups you already have to manage access to cloud based SaaS applications.

## How reliable is Azure AD?

The multi-tenant, geo-distributed, high availability design of Azure AD means that you can rely on it for your most critical business needs. Running out of 28 data centers around the world with automated failover, you’ll have the comfort of knowing that Azure AD is highly reliable and that even if a data center goes down, copies of your directory data are live in at least two more regionally dispersed data centers and available for instant access.
